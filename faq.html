                        Rings Online, Skyrim and so many other titles gave me. And, of course, I want players to have fun.

                    Isn't it too early to create a website?

                    <span>
                        Probably, but I truly believe that when we show our idea, talk about it, even name it... 
                        the chances of it becoming a real thing is way bigger.
