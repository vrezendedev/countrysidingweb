                        Industrialist's early settlements on Planet-X19, some unusual signs
                         patterns were sighted by the local scientists on rocks near the meteorite's
                          impact location - scientists said it seems to be some kind of writing. 
                    </p>

                    <p class= "post-content">A piece of paper was found by a countrysider on the, what is called nowadays, 
                        Industrialist’s Desert… it seems to be some kind of letter.
                    </p>

                            "First, scientists tried to gather some data… they started by analyzing the rock’s texture, 
                            then, they decided to analyze the cuts that formed the signs… it seemed to be some kind of 
                            modern technology that was used to create that, there were no sharp edges, the signs were 
                            engraved on the rock as smooth as possible… so, as the physical analyze wasn’t that promising, 
                            they started extracting sediment from the rocks to understand its composition. Based on the fact 
                            it was mainly formed by quartz grains, feldspar, sandstone… the conclusion was: it is, basically, 
                            a normal fragment of gneiss.

                        <p class="letter-content">
                            Why does it (the signs) keep appearing? And just after the meteorite impact? And what is happening 
                            with the flora? Why is it getting this weird purplish color?
                        </p>

                        <p class="letter-content">
                            In my opinion, something really strange is happening, and these unusual signs may be related to this.

                    <p class= "post-content">Planet-X19 is an uncommon place. And, in this case, uncommon, it’s a euphemism. 
                        All the weirdness started to happen after the meteorite episode… but, a peculiar insight, when someone 
                        visits Moon River Town, everything seems to be so peaceful… maybe the person needs to live there and 
                        become a countrysider to understand what’s really going on with all of this.
