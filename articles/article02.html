                    <p class= "post-content">
                        Countryside life reminds me of inner peace, simple life, traditions, and simple — but harsh — rewarding tasks.
                    </p>

                    <div class="letter">
                        <p class= "letter-content">"[...] It was everywhere — a gelatin —a slime—yet it had shapes, a thousand 
                            shapes of horror beyond all memory. There were eyes — and a blemish." 
                        </p>
                        <p id="letter-sender">- "The Unnamable" by H.P. Lovecraft.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class= "post-content">
                        Cosmic Horror is all about realizing how small and vulnerable you are as a human. Imagine yourself, on 
                        an open field, looking up at the night sky, staring at the stars, glancing at that sudden sparkle 
                        that it emits. The vastness of that black/purplish emptiness space starts growing on your mind. 
                        Now, you are not afraid of being alone but, actually, of not being alone at all. Nothing is more
                        frightening compared to that specific moment when you realize the vastness of the universe.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        The contrast is what makes things being meaningful as themselves and, it's all about showing its core 
                        features. The high contrast between Countryside and Cosmic Horror can create a unique ambiance
                         and, that's the main concern while creating the Countrysiding's world — a.k.a. Planet X-19.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        I think you might be asking yourself how I am approaching this. I'll bring more details in the future 
                        but, it's all about creating the right atmosphere. A game experience doesn't limit itself only on 
                        the creations of its developer but also on the player's interpretation — to achieve what I'm 
                        looking for, I can't deny the player's creativity.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">Character Development: creating real-life resemblance.</span></h2>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Characters are what give life to a story. When creating a game similar to Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, 
                        it's unquestionable that character development is one of the most important aspects to focus on 
                        during your early development. In this case, without your characters, you'll not even have a game.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Game mechanics on RPGs like this have — or should have — strict relations with the characters. 
                        An NPC must feel unreplaceable and, its characteristics need to make it feel unique but 
                        recognizable — the player needs to sympathize with the ideas, thoughts, and feelings. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        The player's character in games like this needs to represent the players or, at least, whom 
                        they want to be. That's why I create a simple backstory for the player's character. Due to 
                        the backstory simplicity, I'll add meaningful multi-choice situations that make a real 
                        difference in the story gameplay and other elements.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Now, I'll present a brief and self-explanatory description of a character that has significant 
                        importance on the gameplay, currently under development: Oswald, the Astronomer.

                            "Oswald is a renowned scientist from Earth that traveled and moved to 
                            Planet X-19 to learn and study about different and unusual celestial 
                            bodies. He informs the local farmers about the weather, seasons, and 
                            weird phenomena. But, somehow, he knows more information than science 
                            can explain. Well respected by the community, he is one of the most 
                            important figures of Moonriver Town."

                        A bit too practical and informative, what about some classic countryside 
                        drama? Jolene is one of the most eccentric characters and might bring some
                        drama alongside the mayor's gossip wife, Ma'am Fynn.

                            of her pregnancy. She saw him leaving through their old house's door and never 
                            coming back. Things got even harder after her sister died during labor — her sister 
                            was already a widow. She needed to take care of the newborn niece named 
                            after her sister: Victoria. Luckily, she received as an inheritance her sister's 
                            farm. Almost, harsh twenty years, the "Countrysiding" program seemed to be the only 
                            solution after losing her farm for the bank due to a lot of unmanageable debts."

                        Characters may participate in others' stories and, not necessarily, have one big 
                        plot just for itself.

                    <h2 class="subtitle">Game Design and Art: decisions.</span></h2>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        In my opinion, deciding on what art style your game will have is an irreversible decision.
                        This decision starts when you choose the technique you will use, and it'll not stop there.
                        This decision has a lot of nuances and little things that will make your life, as a designer,
                        miserable — but, in the end, it's worth it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        There is an undebatable relation between game design and art: art helps transcribe the feelings 
                        that your game design wants to deliver. Every single part of your game is affected by the game 
                        design, and one of the ways to show it for the players is using art. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        That's why I decided to go along with Pixel Art. The mood, the simplicity — yet nostalgic —, the 
                        unrealistic aspect, and other characteristics make it perfect for the game. The specific art 
                        style is Isometric Pixel Art — a not so simple approach but works interestingly with lightning 
                        and allows the creation of uncommon scenarios.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="post-content">
                        The art under development is on a very alpha stage, and it's not ready for exposition. Soon it'll be here.

                    <h2 class="subtitle">Overwhelm? Proseche!</span></h2>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        As I already said: I will not rush anything during the Countrysiding development. I'm learning. I'm making mistakes. I'm relearning.  I'm developing. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Currently, I decided to go way back and relearn the art fundamentals, and it is being a total blast. I'm developing my skills as an artist, and I can feel it — and see it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Alongside the art studies, I'm currently reading the following books: "Think Like a Programmer" by V. Anton Spraul; "The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia" by 
                        Bernard Suits; "Level Up: The Guide to Great Video Game Design" by Scott Rogers.

                    <p class="post-content">
                        To enrich my creativity, I'm reading some of the classic tales by H. P. Lovecraft and "The Silmarillion" by J. R. R. Tolkien. Later, I might start reading 
                        tales written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar Allan Poe.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        Oh, yes, almost forgot. Also, I'm developing my skills as a musician and composer doing little music pieces on Cakewalk — 
                        not worthy of being shown. Now, my final message.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        In one of my introspective moments, I thought about the relationship between a game developer and an artist/designer. We, as game developers, must understand that we are, 
                        first of all, ultimate artists. There is no other way that allows us to show our art so complete than with video games. It's all feelings and sensations tied together by one piece of art. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-content">
                        So: if your art doesn't come from the bottom of your heart, it's not worth anyone's time; create 
                        something that will enable you how to express and present your Weltanschauung; create something
                        that fulfills the emptiness of a rushed daily life; create something that will impact others as 
                        it impacts you. Create art!
