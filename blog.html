            <h1>Why is it "Development's"/"Developer's"?</h1>

                    Everything is about the development of the game but with different approaches. 
                    While being a "Development's" article, it'll show features or assets or technical 
                    or any kind of information about the game and its development - so it'll be, probably, 
                    way more straightforward. While being a "Developer's" article, it'll be a more personal 
                    approach about the game, for example: what I'm currently reading or studying about game 
                    design and how it impacts my decisions as the designer of this game... or, what I'm currently 
                    struggling at as the developer... or what I want to express in certain terms of something that 
                    is already added (or will be) in the game, like why Jasmine's (an NPC) personality is like that 
                    or why the player's character's harvesting animation is like that and what I, as an artist, want 
                    that to signify for the player.
