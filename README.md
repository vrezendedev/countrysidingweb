A repository for my game's website.
<br>
Here you can find all the code (HTML and CSS/Responsive CSS) that I wrote...
<br>
All the art and design was created by me too.
<br>
I pretend to implement Javascript and, maybe, if needed, other web technologies later.
<br>
PS.: In my opinion, as the game, the website is currently on an alpha stage and it will probably change in the future.
